# CFGProject 
Interpreter and REPL for a language specified as a CFG.
# Building The Project
Uses CMake as a build generator. Includes two targets (executables):
- Repl.exe: The main executable; An interactive shell where you can run files and language instructions.
- Tests.exe: A series of simple tests, similar to those specified in the project instructions.
Executables are placed in the 'bin' folder.
